Perfect 🔥 Now we’ll go all-in:
I’ll generate a complete Bolt build prompt that includes:

1. Visual Design Guide (from your video palette).


2. GSAP Motion Timeline (step-by-step animation sequence).


3. Site Structure & Component Breakdown (using shadcn + Tailwind).


4. Interaction Details (hover, scroll, micro-animations).



This way Bolt will have zero ambiguity → it will create a hackathon site that feels like your uploaded video.

⚡ This prompt will push Bolt to create a cinematic, GSAP-driven hackathon site that matches your video energy.

👉 Do you also want me to create a sample GSAP code snippet (for the Hero section text reveal + CTA pulse) so you can inject it directly after Bolt generates the base site?
